/*
  Product pages: what each kind of product page needs, and the pages the site starts with.
  There are two kinds, each drawn by its own template:
  - "subscription" (like milk): one price per unit, Subscribe & save plans (3 / 6 / 12 months) and a
    one-time tab with a bill   → components/product/subscription-product-page.tsx
  - "one-time" (like ghee, paneer, butter, atta, batter): pack sizes, quantity, Add to cart and Buy now
    → components/product/one-time-product-page.tsx
  A page is only data: /products/<slug> finds the entry and the template for its kind draws it.
  The starting pages are below; the Chiranvi Panel adds more ("Add product" on Products & pricing), saved
  by store/product-pages-store.ts (in the browser for now, in Supabase later).
